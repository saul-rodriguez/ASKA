 Therefore, an implicit netlist for this instance has been generated. 

WARNING (VLOGNET-184): Unable to generate explicit netlist for instance 'I1' in the 'ASKA_TOP/aska_core/schematic' cell view because the switch master of this instance is a text view and its place master contains split buses, bundle terminals, or both.
