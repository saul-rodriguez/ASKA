INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the '-viaMap' option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the '-viaMap' option for preserving oaVia instances in a XStream Out - XStream In round trip. Using the '-viaMap' option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.
