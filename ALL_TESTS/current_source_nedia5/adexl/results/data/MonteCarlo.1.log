Monte Carlo Sampling yield summary:
Number of spec values are in this yield data: 1
Montecarlo	Nominal - 
	deriv(IS("/M0/D")):	Yield	0%
		Min 0	Max 0	Mean 0	Number of errors 0

Montecarlo
	Overall Yield	100%	Number of points passed	19	Total number of points	19

Estimated yield = 100% (19/19), 0 errors
Estimated yield (No opregions) = 100% (19/19)
