Warning from spectre during AHDL compile.
    WARNING (VACOMP-1087):
        "/home/saul/projects/ASKA/CURRENT_SOURCE/pulse_control/veriloga/veriloga.va",
        line 7: Encountered Verilog `timescale directive. Verilog-AMS requires
        a `default_transition directive to set the default transition or a
        local transition setting for transition or Z-transform filters. While
        the Verilog-A language will use `timescale in the absence of a
        `default_transition directive, you should always use
        `default_transition to set the default transition time for transition
        or Z-transform (zi_*) filters.
